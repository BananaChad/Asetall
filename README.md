# AsepriteInstaller_Updater
Do you need Aseprite but don't have Money? I've got you! Maybe you've heard of Compiling Aseprite before and found it too hard. But with this tool, all you have to do is Type one single Command and your ready to go! Note that this works for updating too.

When you first open the programm, there are a few requierments:

Visual Studio - (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) On the Installer select Desktop Development with C++ and on Individual Items (Check on Aseprites guide: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md under Windows dependencies).

GitForWindows - (https://gitforwindows.org/) Leave evreything on Default.
