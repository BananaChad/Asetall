# ok how will i do this
# Asetall is a auto installer for popular tool aseprite (https://www.github.com/aseprite/aseprite)
# I am NOT affiliated with aseprite and this is not an official tool

# this script expects you to save files like skia to their default paths, if the script cant find it it will prompt you to A: install for you or B: let you specify a new path


# start by using git clone --recursive https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite.git if it cant find /aseprite
# if it updates ase start by discarding all changes (ADD WARNING!) and git pull and update submodule
